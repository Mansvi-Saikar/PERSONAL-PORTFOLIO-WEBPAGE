##This is a Personal Portfolio Webpage using only HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code. The webpage includes sections like About Me, Skills, Portfolio, and Contact, all arranged in a clean layout. HTML structures the content, while CSS styles the page with a modern, responsive design.This project highlights my front-end development skills.
